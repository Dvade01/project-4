This project makes us use a variety of things such as making our own test cases using nose, using docker to run a test the page manually, 
ajax in the html so that it updates without a form submit, and a python alogorithm that we make to replace the ACP calculator.
In the program we are able to select distance in km, start location, distance cap, the program then calculates the km in miles and returns
valid open and close time intervals.
